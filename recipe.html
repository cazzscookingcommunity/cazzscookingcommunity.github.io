<!-- this is a shell page that is populated by
    xml/recipe.xsl that transforms the recipe.xml
    into html

    There are many ways to do this.  v1 used javascript
    I have tried includimg the xsl style sheet directly
    into the recipe.xml, but this works better for xsd2html2xml.xsl 
    which is XSL 3.0 and is used to edit the recipe.
