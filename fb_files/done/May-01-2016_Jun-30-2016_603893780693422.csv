Super Easy.  Good for a crowd or taking somewhere

Turn on oven to 170D. Grease 20cm x 12cm dish or two loaf trays and set aside.  Combine all ingredients, except bananas and mix well. Add bananas and fold through, then pour into prepared tray. Smooth over top and place in oven for 40-60 minutes or until skew come out clean. Remove from oven and cover immediately with foil. Wait 10-15 minutes before serving while warm or wait until completely cold. You can sprinkle with a little icing sugar when serving.

NB-When my bananas go spotty I pop them in the the freezer. When I have three bananas I make a cake. They look pretty horrible when defrosted, but it makes the cake taste awesome!

Part 2

If  you want to find out if you are allergic to any foods or just want to detox and lose a bit of weight, try this for a month.

No denying it's hard to do, but the key is to prepare your kitchen and pantry, by getting rid of things you don’t want to eat.  Also do the preparation on the weekend so you have a fridge full of good healthy food and snacks.  Good luck it is totally worth it!

The first week will be the most difficult.  Usually with worsening of symptoms, then you will gradually feel much better.  Begin the introduction process only after feeling good for at least one week (7 days), usually WEEK 2-3 week.

Introduce a food by having several servings in one day.  Wait two days then reintroduce again on the third day.  Wait another two days, before you decide to maintain that new food in your diet.  If you have symptoms, such as bloating, gas, pain, indigestion, diarrhoea, constipation, skin redness, rashes, headaches, “cloudy feeling” and/or other signs, after you introduce a new food, you should visit your GP and/or go to a dietitian.
