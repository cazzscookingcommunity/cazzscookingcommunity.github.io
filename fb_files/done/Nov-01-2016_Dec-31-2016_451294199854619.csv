Leg of ham
Packet whole cloves 
Packet star anise
Ginger Glaze
1 cup ginger wine*
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup ginger marmalade 

Cut through skin about 10cm from shank in decorative pattern. Slip finger under widest part of skin and peel back skin and remove. This can be reserved to cover ham while storing. Make shallow cuts diagonally in opposite directions to make diamond shape in fat. Put ham in large baking dish and pour in one cup of water. Cover shank end with foil.  Brush half glaze over ham and put as many star anise over the surface that will fit. Keep them in place with the cloves. Bake in preheat 180C oven for 30 minutes (should be all golden and cooked after 30 mins.). Carefully brush over the remaining glaze and cover loosely with foil. Cook for 30-45 minutes more, depending on the size of your ham. Remove from oven and baking dish and let rest before carving.  You can serve this cold or hot. Reserve the juice in baking dish if desired, which can be served with meat on the side.

Ginger Glaze
Put all ingredients into a small sauce pan and simmer until marmalade and sugar dissolved and sauce thickens. This can be done one week in advanced.

1/3 cup popcorn
1 TBsp butter (can use coconut oil for vegans)
1 TBsp canola oil 
1 TBsp brown sugar
Cinnamon sugar to taste
Microwave proof bowl with lid

Place butter and oil in microwave proof bowl and melt butter and oil in microwave until butter melted (about 20 seconds.) Mix in brown sugar while still hot and stir all until combined, then add pop corn. Stir to coat all the corn and spread out evenly in the base of the bowl so corn is only one corn kernel deep. Place lid on bowl and cook until most of corn popped. This will depend on your microwave and you may need to experiment to get the timing right. My microwave takes about 3 3/4 minutes (not all the corn will pop!) Remove from microwave with oven mitts and carefully turn inside down and give a good shake. If your lid does not allow you to do this then stir well and ensure to get the melted juices up from the bottom to help coat all the popcorn. Give a good generous shake of cinnamon sugar on top or just plain cinnamon if you don't have cinnamon sugar. Then put your feet up turn on the movie and enjoy!
