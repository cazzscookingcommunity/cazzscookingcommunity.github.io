  <ingredient>1/3 cup popcorn</ingredient>
  <ingredient>1 TBsp butter (can use coconut oil for vegans)</ingredient>
  <ingredient>1 TBsp canola oil </ingredient>
  <ingredient>1 TBsp brown sugar</ingredient>
  <ingredient>Cinnamon sugar to taste</ingredient>
  <ingredient>Microwave proof bowl with lid</ingredient>
  <step>
Place butter and oil in microwave proof bowl and melt butter and oil in microwave until butter melted (about 20 seconds.) Mix in brown sugar while still hot and stir all until combined, then add pop corn. Stir to coat all the corn and spread out evenly in the base of the bowl so corn is only one corn kernel deep. Place lid on bowl and cook until most of corn popped. This will depend on your microwave and you may need to experiment to get the timing right. My microwave takes about 3 3/4 minutes (not all the corn will pop!) Remove from microwave with oven mitts and carefully turn inside down and give a good shake. If your lid does not allow you to do this then stir well and ensure to get the melted juices up from the bottom to help coat all the popcorn. Give a good generous shake of cinnamon sugar on top or just plain cinnamon if you dont have cinnamon sugar. Then put your feet up turn on the movie and enjoy!
