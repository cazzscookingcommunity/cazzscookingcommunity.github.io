    <ingredient>4 eggs separated</ingredient>
    <ingredient>1/2 cup caster sugar</ingredient>
    <ingredient>1-2 cups strong black coffee</ingredient>
    <ingredient>250 gms mascarpone </ingredient>
    <ingredient>1/2 block dark chocolate shaved</ingredient>
    <ingredient>Cocoa (lumps removed)</ingredient>
    <ingredient>1 packet sponge fingers</ingredient>

    <step>
Whip eggs whites until soft peaks form. Stir egg yolks and sugar together until sugar is dissolved. Add the mascarpone to egg yoke mixture. Then fold the egg whites into egg yoke mixture, until combined. Rub a small amount of this mixture around a square or rectangular pan. Place the coffee in a flat dish. Dip a sponge finger in the coffee and wet both sides. Place a layer of coffee dipped sponge fingers in deep baking dish, then top with a thin layer of egg mixture, covering the surface. Sprinkle over a thin layer of cocoa, then sprinkle a thin layer of shaved chocolate. Top with another layer of coffee dipped sponge fingers and egg mixture and cocoa and chocolate. Repeat layers at least thee times until you reach the top of the pan, finishing with cocoa and chocolate on top layer. Cover with glad wrap and place in fridge over night. Cut into squares and serve cold.
