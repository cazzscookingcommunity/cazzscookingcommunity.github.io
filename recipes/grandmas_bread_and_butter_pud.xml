    <comment>Great for any leftover stale bread- I usually use raisin toast, this photo was taken using fruit scones.</comment>

    <ingredient>6 fruit scones cut in half*</ingredient>
    <ingredient>2 cups milk</ingredient>
    <ingredient>2 eggs </ingredient>
    <ingredient>3 TBSP sugar</ingredient>
    <ingredient>1 teaspoon vanilla essence</ingredient>
    <ingredient>Handful of sultanas (optional)</ingredient>
    <ingredient>Butter and Jam</ingredient>

    <step>Grease a pan with butter or margarine and set aside. Heat oven to 175C. Butter both cut sides of scones and one side with jam. Put together like a sandwich and cut into quarters and place in pan until all scones used up. Sprinkle over sultanas. In a bowl beat eggs with milk, sugar and essence. Pour milk mixture over bread and place in oven for 20-30 minutes. There should be no wet bits when done. Cover with foil if getting too brown while cooking. Serve alone or with cream and/or ice cream.</step>

    <step>if using bread (not fruit scones) butter and jam each slice and place one piece on top of the other, like you are making a sandwich. Cut each sandwich into 16ths,
    and place in pan. If using plain bread I would definitely throw in a handful of sultanas! </step>
