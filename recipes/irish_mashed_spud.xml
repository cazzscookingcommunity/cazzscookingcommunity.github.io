    <ingredient>1/4 head cabbage chopped</ingredient>
    <ingredient>3 rashes bacon chopped </ingredient>
    <ingredient>2 TBsp olive oil</ingredient>
    <ingredient>2 TBsp butter</ingredient>
    <ingredient>1 stock chicken stock cube</ingredient>
    <ingredient>1/4 cup water</ingredient>
    <ingredient>4-6 cups ready made mashed spud</ingredient>
    <ingredient>salt and pepper to taste</ingredient>

    <step>
Heat fry pan on medium heat and add olive oil then butter. Once butter is melted add bacon and cook until crispy. Next add water and stock cube,  crushing it into bits as you add it to the pan. Add the cabbage and cover with a lid. After five minutes lower heat to low and stir well. Place lid back on fry pan and wait another 10 minutes or until the cabbage is wilted. You can cook your spuds while you do this if you havent any prepared. When the cabbage is done give it a good stir to incorporate all the ingredients.  Add hot prepared mash, stirring to combine both. Serve with cracked pepper and some fresh herbs sprinkled on top. Take care if adding salt because the bacon, stock cube and mash spud will all have salt added.
Great if you have some left over mash, or you can cheat and use  frozen mash or powder mash.
