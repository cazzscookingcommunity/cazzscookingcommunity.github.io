  <ingredient>1/3 cup popcorn</ingredient>
  <ingredient>1 TBsp butter (can use coconut oil for vegans)</ingredient>
  <ingredient>1 TBsp canola oil </ingredient>
  <ingredient>1 TBsp brown sugar</ingredient>
  <ingredient>Cinnamon sugar to taste</ingredient>
  <ingredient>Microwave proof bowl with lid</ingredient>
  <step>Place butter and oil in microwave proof bowl and melt butter and oil in microwave until butter melted (about 20 seconds.</step>
  <step>) Mix in brown sugar while still hot and stir all until combined, then add pop corn.</step>
  <step>Stir to coat all the corn and spread out evenly in the base of the bowl so corn is only one corn kernel deep.</step>
  <step>Place lid on bowl and cook until most of corn popped.</step>
  <step>This will depend on your microwave and you may need to experiment to get the timing right.</step>
  <step>My microwave takes about 3 3/4 minutes (not all the corn will pop!) Remove from microwave with oven mitts and carefully turn inside down and give a good shake.</step>
  <step>If your lid does not allow you to do this then stir well and ensure to get the melted juices up from the bottom to help coat all the popcorn.</step>
  <step>Give a good generous shake of cinnamon sugar on top or just plain cinnamon if you dont have cinnamon sugar.</step>
  <step>Then put your feet up turn on the movie and enjoy!.</step>
