  <ingredient>2 eggs </ingredient>
  <ingredient>3 TBSP sugar</ingredient>

  <step>Put together like a sandwich and cut into quarters and place in pan until all scones used up.</step>

  <step>Cover with foil if getting too brown while cooking.</step>

  <step>if using bread (not fruit scones) butter and jam each slice and place one piece on top of the other, like you are making a sandwich.</step>
