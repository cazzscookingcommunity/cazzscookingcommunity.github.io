Turn in oven to 180C. Prepare large pie dish by greasing with a bit of oil or butter and set aside. Slice the sweet potatoes with a mandolin or peeler into very thin slices. Place lid n a bowl with the olive oil and seasoning be with salt and pepper. Toss with your hands until all slices are coated. Place a layer clovering  the enter pie dish, then continue another layer until all pieces are used. Ideally you want at least 2-3 layers thick. Place in over for 15 minutes and remove to cool.  Meanwhile beat eggs and cream with a whisk. Mix up n other veggies except the tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and pour into pie crust. Place tomatoes on top and bake until centre cooked, about 30-40 minutes. Serve hot or cold with a side of salad- yum!
