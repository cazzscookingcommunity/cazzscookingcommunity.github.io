Tin of ready apple pie filling ( if you want to cheat)

Cream sugar and butter, then add egg. Add flour and salt, then milk 1/3 cup first then if it seems dry add the rest to make up to 1/2 cup. Divide in two and roll into balls and wrap in glad wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour. Prepare dish by greasing with a little butter and use your hands to push one ball into the dish to make the base. Pour in apple and make flat with the back of a spoon. Grate the other ball until all used up and top completely covered. Cook in slow oven for one hour. Serve with ice cream and/or cream. Great hot or cold!
