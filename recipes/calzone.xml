    <ingredient>200 gms grated cheese</ingredient>
    <ingredient>Olive oil</ingredient>

    <step>
Heat oven to 180 degrees and spray baking tray with olive oil, set aside. Flour bench and roll out dough to a big oval and till the dough is approximately 2-3 mm thick.  Spread tapenade along the middle and sprinkle cheese on top of tapenade. Paint a little olive oil on the edges and bring the long edges together in the middle and squeeze them together and fold them over as you move along the length. It should look like a pasty with no gaps or else your contents will leak out. Carefully lift onto tray and paint entire surface generously with olive oil. Bake for 20-30 mins until golden brown. Cut in slices and serve hot or cold. Make two at a time because it gets eaten very quickly ðŸ˜€
