    <diet>GlutenFree</diet>

    <ingredient>300 gms Gluten Free flour (Aldi brand)</ingredient>
    <ingredient>1 egg</ingredient>
    <ingredient>1 1/2 scant teaspoon gluten free baking powder </ingredient>
    <ingredient>1 cup sugar (I use coconut sugar but feel free to use regular caster sugar)</ingredient>
    <ingredient>200 gms butter </ingredient>
    <ingredient>1 teaspoon vanilla essence </ingredient>

    <step>
Prepare three baking sheets by covering them with baking paper. In a bowl whisk together all dry ingredients. Cut butter up into small cubes and rub into the dry ingredients until it resembles crumbs and there are no clumps of butter. Crack egg into mixture and pour in vanilla essence. Stir until all combined. Roll into a bowl and cover with wrap and place in fridge for 30 minutes. While dough in fridge preheat oven to 160 C. Once dough firm roll out better two pieces of baking paper, until it is 5mm thick. Cut with cookie cutter or a small glass and carefully place on the trays. You can use a spatula or a knife to transfer cookies to the trays. Evenly distributed the cookies and place in oven for 10-12 minutes or until golden colour. Cool on wire wrack until completely cool and store in airtight container.
