    <ingredient>500gms Chicken tenderloins</ingredient>
    <ingredient>4 eggs beaten </ingredient>
    <ingredient>1/2 cup flour</ingredient>
    <ingredient>1 cup bread crumbs </ingredient>
    <ingredient>Salt</ingredient>
    <ingredient>Olive oil (not extra virgin)</ingredient>

    <step>
On a cutting board arrange a few tenders flat and cover with cling wrap. Use rolling pin to flatten, either by beating or rolling until the tenders are about 4-5 mm thick. Once all done salt well. In low flat dishes (like a pie dish or plate) pour out flour first, then eggs and lastly bread crumbs in separate dishes in a row. First dip the individual tender in flour then eggs and lastly bread crumbs. Make sure to coat completely between each layer.  Lay out on a plate and continue until all pieces have been coated.
Heat enough olive oil (should come up the side about 1 cm) in a fry pan to medium to hot heat. Cook a few pieces at a time making sure not to over crowd the pan. You may need to tip up the oil if needed. Drain schnitzels on grease proof paper.
Serve schnitzel with chips and/or salad. Can double or triple recipe. Refrigerate any pieces not consumed immediately (unlikely ðŸ˜‰)
