Divide in two and roll into balls and wrap in glad wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour. Prepare dish by greasing with a little butter and use your hands to push one ball into the dish to make the base. Pour in apple and make flat with the back of a spoon. Grate the other ball until all used up and top completely covered. Cook in slow oven for one hour. Serve with ice cream and/or cream. Great hot or cold!
