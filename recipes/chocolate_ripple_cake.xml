  <ingredient>Packet of chocolate ripple biscuits </ingredient>
  <ingredient>600gms cream whipped</ingredient>
  <ingredient>1 cup Masala</ingredient>
  <step>
Put Marsala in a cereal bowl. Dip a biscuit in the masala then place about 1 tbsp of cream on it, then place on a tray, cream side up. Dip next biscuit in the Marsala and place about tbsp of cream on it and place on top of the other biscuit. Do this with another few biscuits until you can turn them on their side on the tray. Continue adding biscuits and cream until all biscuits or your tray can no longer take any more. Coat the entire outside surface with cream. Sprinkle the top with crushed flake bar or strawberries. Cover completely with glad wrap and place in the fridge over night. When cutting to serve, cut on a large diagonal to get stripy effect.
