  <step>
Heat oil in large fry pan or wok. On medium heat add garlic and cook until golden, about 4-6 minutes.  Add zucchini and carrot and stir to fry all. Add everything except spinach and eggs and bring to boil and then turn down to simmer, stirring along the way. Once all mixed together add spinach, storks included and stir in well. At this stage you can place lid on pan and pop in preheated oven (180C) while you boil the eggs. You can also leave on stove top if you want the mixture to reduce. Once eggs boiled, crack and peel each one. Alternatively you can fry the eggs, if you prefer.  Serve them on top of the lentils once you have served it in a bowl or plate. This recipe can be doubled. This can be made vegan by removing the eggs!  It is also nice with crusty bread as alternative to the egg.
