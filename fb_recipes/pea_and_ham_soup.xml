Pea and Ham Soup
FODMAP friendly

Packet green split peas
2 large carrots chopped
1 teaspoon mixed spice
1 teaspoon pepper
1-2 bay leaves
1-2 garlic cloves crushed
1 whole ham hock (Bertocchi)
SandP to taste

Rinse peas under running water and remove any foreign objects. Place in large pot with all other ingredients except SandP.  Pour in enough water to cover everything plus up to your thumb joint more. Bring to the boil then turn down to a simmer until meat is falling off the bone (4-6hrs.) Remove hock from soup and remove skin and discard. Shred the meat with a small knife or two forks. Place back in soup with the bones, these will help thicken the soup. When the soup is at your desired thickness remove the bones and add SandP to taste, check first before adding. Some hocks are more salty than others. Bertocchi ham hocks give the most consistent best flavour. This recipe takes hours and is one for a rainy day spent inside, but well worth it!
