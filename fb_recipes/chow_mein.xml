CHOW MEIN
Easy, Quick, Yummy and FOMAP Friendly

500-600 gms Pork Mince
Two small rice noodles (each about same size of two minute noodle packet)
2 Carrots grated
1/2 head cabbage* chopped
3 spring onions chopped
2-3 garlic cloves crushed
1/2 cup stir fry sauce*
2 chicken stock cubes
1/2 cup water + extra boiling water for cooking noodles
SandP
Oil

Heat large fry pan with lid and add oil.  Cook garlic until golden then add pork. While pork is cooking (prepare your veggies and cook noodles by covering with boiling water in a bowl and drain after two minutes, then chop with kitchen scissors.) Cook pork until no longer pink.  Add cabbage and 1/2 cup of water and stock cubes.  Place lid on pan and steam for 10 minutes. Remove lid and add carrots and noodles. Pour over stir fry sauce, add SandP to taste and stir to combine. Serve with spring onions sprinkled on top and extra soy sauce if desired.

* you can use regular cabbage or Chinese cabbage or even Bok Choy ( whatever takes your fancy)
* if you can not find stir fry sauce you can substitute with soy sauce thickened with some corn flour
