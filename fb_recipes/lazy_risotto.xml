1/2 teaspoon chilli powder
140 gms tomatoe paste
1 1/2 cups arborio rice
750ml chicken stock
1/4 cut chopped parsley
2-3 spring onions chopped

Heat oil in oven proof dish and cook bacon until nicely brown. Add garlic and cook for a few minutes until golden. Cook chicken in batches until all done. Add rice to pan and cook a few minutes, stirring continuously until all coated.  Add all other ingredients except spring onions and stir to combine.
