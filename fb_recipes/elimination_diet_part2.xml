ELIMINATION DIET_part2

Part 2

If  you want to find out if you are allergic to any foods or just want to detox and lose a bit of weight, try this for a month.

No denying it's hard to do, but the key is to prepare your kitchen and pantry, by getting rid of things you don’t want to eat.  Also do the preparation on the weekend so you have a fridge full of good healthy food and snacks.  Good luck it is totally worth it!

The first week will be the most difficult.  Usually with worsening of symptoms, then you will gradually feel much better.  Begin the introduction process only after feeling good for at least one week (7 days), usually WEEK 2-3 week.

Introduce a food by having several servings in one day.  Wait two days then reintroduce again on the third day.  Wait another two days, before you decide to maintain that new food in your diet.  If you have symptoms, such as bloating, gas, pain, indigestion, diarrhoea, constipation, skin redness, rashes, headaches, “cloudy feeling” and/or other signs, after you introduce a new food, you should visit your GP and/or go to a dietitian.

Next post is a suggested menu for you to follow.  It's a bit boring after week four, but it  will get you started.
