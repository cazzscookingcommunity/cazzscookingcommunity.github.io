MM Veggie Soup

2 lamb shanks or other lamb bones
1 swede chopped
1 turnip chopped
1 parsnip chopped
2 celery sticks chopped
2 large carrots chopped
250 gms McKenzies soup mix
1 bay leaf
Stock to cover 
SandP to taste

Place all ingredients in a large pot and cover with stock until it is up to your thumb joint over all ingredients. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Remove scum from the top and cook until the meat is falling of the bone (about 4-6 hours.) Remove shanks and shred meat with knife and fork. Place all back into the pot, including the bones. Cook until soup thickens, usually another 1-2 hours. Remove bones and season with SandP.  Serve with crusty bread. You can freeze the soup or cook in slow cooker on low for 8-10 hours.

This one of my families favourites.  Good to cook on a day you intent spending at home!
