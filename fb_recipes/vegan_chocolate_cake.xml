1 1/2 cups flour 
(*Replace with gluten free flour if desired)
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup pure cocoa
1/2 cup oil
1 cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 TBspoon vinegar

Icing
1 1/2 cup icing sugar sifted
2 TBspoons cocoa sifted
1 TBspoon Nutalex melted
1-2 TBspoons Boiling water

( not appropriate for vegan or diary intolerant)

Grease cake pan and put grease proof paper in the bottom and set aside. Turn on oven to 180D.  Sift dry ingredients and stir to combine. Pour in wet ingredients and stir to combine.  Pour into prepared pan and cook for 30-40 minutes or until skewer comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes and turn out into a plate. Let cool completely before icing.

Icing
Stir dry ingredients together and add Nutalex. Add water one TBspoon at a time until you get your desired consistency.  Spread over cooled cake and decorated with what you desired ( MandMs, shredded coconut, fresh berries, sprinkles are a few examples.)

You can also make it into cupcakes. Reduce cooking time to 10-15 minutes.
